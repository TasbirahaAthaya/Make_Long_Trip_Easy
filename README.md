# Make Long Trip Easy (2016)

Our aim is to lessen peopleâ€™s suffering when they wish to travel or journey in distance places. Sometimes people find difficulties to travel distant places for work field related purposes especially in different occasions and festivals. They face problem to find correct vehicle for long route. Collecting tickets during festival is also a burning issue in our country. So we are introducing an application to the people of Bangladesh which will reduce this problem with the tap of a button.

## Application Features:
1. A selection option whether the user wants to travel by train or bus.
2. Schedules & timings.
3. Counter/railway location and contact information.
4. Online ticket booking information.
5. Significant cities to travel.

See the **Project_report.pdf** for more information.
